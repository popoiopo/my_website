		<h1>Ever wondered where the happiest people live?</h1>

		<p><strong>The Happy Planet Charter</strong> </br> We need new measures of human progress.</p> <blockquote class="quote">The Happy Planet Index offers us an excellent example of how such measures work in practice. It shows that while the challenges faced by rich resource-intensive nations and those with high levels of poverty and deprivation may be very different, the end goal is the same: long and happy lives that donâ€™t cost the earth. We must balance the prominence currently given to GDP with those measures that take seriously the challenges we face in the 21st century: creating economies that deliver sustainable well-being for all. </blockquote> <p> In the following graphs show all kinds of variables that may influence ones happiness inside a given country. With these variables the people at the happy planet index have calculated their own index (HPI) to measure happiness. With all this information we have a pretty complete picture of people living in the given countries. </p><p>So don't hesitate to have a look around and play with the visualisations! Each country gives all the variables inside a pop-up, and when you click the country, the corresponding line in the parrallel coordinates graph turns red. If you then hover over the red line, the corresponding country is again given in a pop-up. Furthermore the order of the variables can be changed, and you can make a selection of the lines on each axis! And if you click on a variable name the map switches to display that variable. <strong>Have fun!</strong></p>
